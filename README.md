# Report for the Foundation

Analyst Klaudia (founder of the blog https://jezykdanych.pl/) created a charity venture called #BI_NGO, which helps beginner analysts develop their skills with real social issues. The first edition #BI_NGO concerned the Gajusz Foundation, which needed visuals for educational purposes and to inform the public about the scale of the above phenomena across Poland and/or in specific provinces.

## Problem Statement

Analyst Klaudia (founder of the blog https://jezykdanych.pl/) created a charity venture called #BI_NGO, which helps beginner analysts develop their skills with real social issues. The first edition involved the Gajusz Foundation, which cared in highlighting two social challenges:

1.Abandonment of newborns in the hospital by their biological parents,

2.Raising children in foster care, i.e. in foster families and children's homes.

### Steps followed 
1.Selected key data sets and processed the raw data.

2.Gajusz Foundation colors and fonts were downloaded and implemented.

3.Calculations and visualizations were prepared.

4.Interpreted key results from visualizations.
